# Web Development Learning Projects 
This repository contains my collection of web development learning projects, created as part of my continuous self-study journey. Each project applies concepts I’ve learned from various online resources, with guidance from AI as a mentor (without directly generating or altering my code).

Although the projects may be similar to common tutorials found online, all implementations are written in my own way to reinforce my understanding of different technologies

This repository will remain active until I complete my degree (expected August 2027), and will serve as a public record of my learning progress.
